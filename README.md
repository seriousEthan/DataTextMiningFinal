# DataTextMiningFinal

I used data/text mining to study beer and bars/breweries. The doc is the R code in document form.  I have a video presentation explaining the project available but it is to large to host here.  please contact me at seriousethan@gmail.com and I will send the video file if you would like.  The R code is pretty well annotated with a summary of the results at the end.  I aplogize for the length fo the document.
